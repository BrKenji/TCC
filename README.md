# Activation Function

## Softmax Function: 

* it calculates the probabilities distribution of the event over K different events
* this function will calculate the probabilities of each target class over all possible target classes
* the range will be 0 to 1, and the sum of all the probabilities will be equal to one

## Dataset Diagnostics Values
* 0 -> Sem anomalia
* 1 -> CMD
* 2 -> CMH
